Think of a directory name as a property tag rather than thinking of it as a place to put things.

Hence we say ‘document’  instead of ‘documents’ because it is a tag that appears on a single file.

I want to move to a method of using tags for the file system in general.

I still use abreviations for command names.  Though I would prefer perhaps that the command names were
written out and that the shell found them with abreviations.  Or perhaps in an intermediate form
that symlinks with abreviated names point at the commands.
